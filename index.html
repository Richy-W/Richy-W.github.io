                <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Richard Wren. After several years in the Electric Vehicle industry I decided to persue a dream career as a Junior Developer.
                     I began taking classes at <a href="https://www.occc.edu/" target="blank">Oklahoma City Community College</a> in 2020 to earn an &quot;AAS in Computer Science/Computer Programming.&quot;
                     I continued that trajectory until 2022, when I deciced to add in a &quot;Certificate of Web Development.&quot; I am set to attain my certificate in May of 2024, and finish my associates
                     in May the following year. I am happy to say I have maintained a full time career while achieving my goals.</p>
