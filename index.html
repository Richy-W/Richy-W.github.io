                <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                <p>Before the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Richard began learning to code as a hobby. Although the process was long and arduous, it quickly became a passion. Once the pandemic hit in full force, Richard was laid off. Although this was a scary time for everyone, Richard decided to take this time build his skills and take his coding journey more seriously and enrolled in classes at <a href="https://www.occc.edu/" target="blank">Oklahoma City Community College</a>. After three months of unemployment Richard returned to work, but this time with a renewed sense of purpose.  </p>
