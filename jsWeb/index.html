			<h1>Welcome to the Client-Side</h1>
			<p>In web development, data can be processed in two ways. This website we will focus on the client-side. Client-side refers to data processing done on the clientâ€™s or user's machine. Most websites achieve this through the implementation of JavaScript to create functionality within today's dynamic digital landscape.</p>
			<br>
			
				<h2>JavaScript</h2>
				<p>JavaScript is the primary language used by front-end web developers. Often it is used to create dynamic features and behaviors for web applications. JavaScript code is interpreted and ran in the web browser of the client machine.</p>
			
				<h2>DOM</h2>
				<p>The Document Object Model is an Application Program Interface (API) that is managed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-DOM/introduction.html">W3C</a>. The Dom describes how to access content through a tree-like hierarchal structure. It creates a common standard across web browsers, ensuring  cross-compatibility. This allows a developer to write the code one time and know that anyone on any browser will see the project as intended.</p>
			
				<h2>AJAX</h2>
				<p>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML or AJAX is an approach to web development that makes it possible to update a part of a web page without reloading. This approach allows for more dynamic web pages as data is exchanged with the server behind the scenes. This allows the webpage to be more responsive.</p>

				<h2>JQuery</h2>
				<p>JQuery is one of the most popular frameworks for JavaScript. It is used to easily traverse and manipulate the DOM. The JQuery framework is robust enough that web applications can fully be developed on it.</p>
